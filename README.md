## What is it?

A utility that allows you to easily choose a random item from a list of items. However,
rather than having uniform random distribution of the choices, it will allow you to
assign a "weight" to each item so that things that "weigh" more will be chosen more often.


## How do I use it?

Here's an example of how you can use this library:

```js
'use strict';

var WRS = require('weighted-random-selection'),
    ads, wrs;

ads = [
   { name: 'Ad 1', clickthroughPctg: 0.1 },
   { name: 'Ad 2', clickthroughPctg: 0.2 },
   { name: 'Ad 3', clickthroughPctg: 0.4 },
];

function clickthroughWeight(ad) {
   // the simplest type of weight transformer: returning a field
   // that already contains a valid value for the weighting:
   return ad.clickthroughPctg;
}

wrs = new WRS(clickthroughWeight);
wrs.setItems(ads);
for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
   console.log(wrs.next().name);
}
```

In this example, you should roughly get:

   * Ad 1: 14.29% of the time (1 in 7, or 0.1 in 0.7)
   * Ad 2: 28.57% of the time (2 in 7, or 0.2 in 0.7)
   * Ad 3: 57.14% of the time (4 in 7, or 0.4 in 0.7)


## API

### Constructor

The constructor of `WeightedRandomSelection` must be passed a function that returns a weight
for each item in the list  that is being randomly-selected from. In the example above, that
is the `clickthroughWeight` function.

The constructor can be passed an optional second argument `items` which initializes the items
in the list without needing to call `setItems` separately.

### setItems

The `setItems` function is passed a list of `items` that are being selected from. When
`setItems` is called, internally the WRS will recalculate all of the weights of the
items by calling your weighting function once for each item.

Returns the instance of WRS so that you can chain calls together, e.g.
`wrs = new WRS(foo).setItems(items).setAllowRepeatDistance(n);`

### setAllowRepeatsDisregardDistance

Calling this function tells WRS that it can return the same item multiple times in a row,
which is the natural behavior of random selection. This is enabled by default.

However, in some applications, you want a "random" item, but you don't want that item to
be one that has been selected in the recent *n* iterations. For that behavior,
see `setAllowRepeatDistance`.

Returns the instance of WRS so that you can chain calls together, e.g.
`wrs = new WRS(foo).setItems(items).setAllowRepeatDistance(n);`

### setAllowRepeatDistance

Call this function with a positive integer equal to the number of items that must appear
between repeats of an item being selected. For example, say that you have a total of
1,000 advertisement objects you are "randomly" selecting from, named "ad 1" through
"ad 1,000". They have varying weights based on whatever you are using to weight them.
However, you don't want the same ad to appear multiple times in a row - if "ad 1" was
returned once, you want at least *n* other ads to appear before "ad 1" can be returned
again. In that case, call `setAllowRepeatDistance(n)`.

NOTE: if you set the repeat distance to a number less than the number of items you have,
WRS will allow repeats even though you didn't want them. This is a safeguard for you.

Returns the instance of WRS so that you can chain calls together, e.g.
`wrs = new WRS(foo).setItems(items).setAllowRepeatDistance(n);`

### next

This is the function that actually returns to you a random item from your set of items.


## Various Weighting Examples

Of course, in the example above you may not want a straight progression where Ad 3 that
is performing four times as well Ad 1 gets used 4x as frequently. Maybe you want it to
be 8x as frequently, or want some logarithmic scale. That's where you simply adjust
your weighting transformer to apply whatever weight you want to the object in question.
Here are some examples:

```js
// I want better-performing ads to be ranked much higher than lesser-performing ads:
function clickthroughWeight(ad) {
   // Results in (roughly):
   // Ad 1: 4.76%
   // Ad 2: 19.05%
   // Ad 3: 76.19%
   return Math.pow(ad.clickthroughPctg, 2);
}

// Or, I want ads to be more evenly distributed than the simple example:
function clickthroughWeight(ad) {
   // Results in (roughly):
   // Ad 1: 25.62%
   // Ad 2: 33.33%
   // Ad 3: 41.05%
   return Math.log(ad.clickthroughPctg * 100);
}
```

Obviously, you can use any calculation that you want to obtain your weighting. For instance,
if you wanted to rank newer items first (for some object that has a `createdDate` property,
you could use this:

```js
function objectWeight(o) {
   var ageInMS = Date.now() - o.creationDate.getTime(),
       dividend = (365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // approx number of millis in a year

   // Results in (roughly):
   // Something that is 1 hour old being selected 14.1 times more frequently than the oldest item
   // Something that is 1 day old being selected 9.5 times more frequently than the oldest item
   // Something that is 1 week old being selected 6.7 times more frequently than the oldest item
   // Anything 365 days or older (365 in our dividend) having a weight of 1
   return Math.max(1, Math.log2(dividend / ageInMS));
}
```
